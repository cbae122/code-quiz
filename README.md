# code-quiz

## Description
- Motivation to build a quiz for coding was based on the past couple of classes. Classes were taught on Javascript and web APIs and the behind tools of how Javascript and web APIs can make a website interactive.
- I built the code quiz to take what I've learned these past couple of days during bootcamp. We learned that we can have Javascript call a function and execute said function to make a tool based on the needs a person might have.
- This project solves the problem for students wanting to refresh their knowledge on JavaScript by taking a quiz with multiple choice answers.
- I learned that Javascript allows your website/tool to function. It takes your variables and applies them to functions and executes the functions based on your needs which is defined in the if and else if statements.
